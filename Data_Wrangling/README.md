# Data Wrangling Project

## Overview
This project focuses on wrangling real-world data from multiple sources to prepare it for analysis. The goal was to assess data quality, clean and transform raw datasets, and produce analysis-ready data using Python and Pandas.

## Data Sources
- **Minimum Wage Dataset** (CSV): Contains state-level minimum wage information.
- **Secondary Dataset** (External Link): Referenced via text file and retrieved programmatically.

## Key Tasks Performed
- Data gathering from file-based and external sources
- Assessment of data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formatting)
- Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas
- Merging datasets to support downstream analysis

## Tools & Skills
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data wrangling & cleaning
- Exploratory data preparation

## Files
- `/data/` – Raw data files and dataset references  
- `/notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook containing the data wrangling workflow
